You must have your final submission code uploaded to the competition GitHub Classroom as shown by your teacher.
You must also submit a short video presentation showcasing your endeavour no longer than 2 mins maximum. You can do this using [MS Stream](https://web.microsoftstream.com/) with your office365 account. 
<sub>Videos here are private by default to our school and you can record your screen easily.</sub>

- Winners will be announced the following week.

## Your Challenge 
You are tasked with creating a new virtual assistant for Mr Mulla called "Pasham" such as the likes of Google Assistant or Alexa.

You will be graded on the features that your virtual assistant will include. Your grade will be higher based on how many of the following faetures you can incorporate:

- The virtual assistant activates with a button press using a GUI interface
- The virtual assistant activates with the voice command, "Hey Pasham!"
    - On request, "tell me a joke", Pasham tells a funny joke,
    - On request, "How's the weather today, Pasham returns the weather in London.
    - On request, "Tell me a recipe", Pasham picks a random recipe from the list of recipes provided in the resources directory :-)
    - On request, "Is it *Turkish* or *Greek* Coffee?", Pasham rightfully points out that **it is indeed Turkish Coffee** and cites the unesco declaration of it's inclusion under the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity [Unesco citation](https://ich.unesco.org/en/decisions/8.COM/8.28), [Unesco information](https://ich.unesco.org/en/what-is-intangible-heritage-00003).
    - on request, "sing me happy birthday", Pasham sings happy birthday!

## Peer Grading 40%

Your peers will rank their favourite submissions in order. How much you recieve in points will be based on how many submissions there are.
***If*** there are **10 submissions** there are a total of **9 potential marks**. ***If there are 15 submissions, there are 14 potential marks***.

Participants will not be able to see who is part of each group. Only your teachers can see this and as such students will not know who the video presentation belongs to.

## Final grading

```python
teacher_grade = int(input("enter teacher grade"))
peer_grade = int(input("enter peer grade"))
final_grade = (teacher_grade * 0.6) + (peer_grade * 0.4)

```
